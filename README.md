# Comp433-Final-Project
Our final project for this class was making an Android App using Android Studio that allows the user to draw or take a picture. Then using Google's Cloud Vision API, it would return us tags of that picture. We then can save the picture our database if we want to using SQLite for data storage. The user is also allowed to add their own tags if they want. Then the user can select up to 3 pictures and we will use those tags from the pictures to generate a random story using TextCortex's Text to Story API. Then it will read the story outloud using text to speech.

An extra thing I didn't have to do but did for bonus points was made it so when you draw a picture, you can change the font size or the color of the brush. 

This class was cool because we actually made a functional app and was taught how to use APIs. To make the app look nicer, I made mine Animal Crossing themed.
